- **Week 3:** **Mon** - squat was moderate/heavy; cracked my lower left rib (I think); I think the belt was a bit tight plus I had slightly injured that area two weeks ago when I used my old belt which was too tight; RDL was moderate and ROM was limited due to the sharp rib pain; lunge form continues to improve; plank was tough. **Tue** - rest day; rib still hurts the same as yesterday. **Wed** - another rest day; I think it's a abdominal side muscle pain rather than a cracked rib; pain is a bit less today. **Thur** - did rehab work. **Fri** - OH press and shrug irritated the side injury a little but not too bad. **Sat** - side injury is feeling a little better. **Sun** - side injury is continuing to improve; try to add some Lower movements next week. **Recap** - set back by yet another injury.

- **Week 2:** **Mon** - squat was moderate/heavy with good form but I still have a tendency to lean forward on occasion; RDL was moderate with good form; lunge was better than last week but the right big toe still hurts; plank was also easier than last week. **Tue** - OH press felt lighter than last week. **Wed** - deadlift was moderate with good form; goblet squat was a bitch. **Thur** - DB bench is easier on the shoulder than BB bench but it was still a bit sore afterwards; delt fly felt easier, go for 12.5 next week; go for 15 on Lu raise next week. **Fri** - rest. **Sat** - squat was moderate/heavy probably due to having slept poorly the night before; hip thrust is much easier with a pad. **Sun** - rest. **Recap** - solid week again; my deadlift is finally starting to look decent; squat is still not great but is getting better; shoulder and elbow are still hurting.

- Started Block 2 (6 weeks) of Alec Enkiri's program. **Week 1:** **Mon** - used a belt on squat for the first time since my last PR attempt and it helped; front rack lunge was light but balancing made it challenging; weighted plank was tough; OH press last set was a bit tougher than expected but w/o shoulder pain. **Tue** - ended up taking a rest day as I was quite tired from Monday's workout. **Wed** - deadlift was a bit lighter than I expected with good form; it's easier to stay focused and maintain good form with lower rep sets; goblet squat was light/moderate; go for 20 reps next week. **Thur** - skipped rack chin-up as it didn't agree with my right elbow; DB bench press was painless. **Fri** - squat was light/moderate with improved form; good morning felt light. **Sat** - suitcase hold aggravates the elbow a little, don't extend the arm fully. **Sun** - rest. **Recap** - solid week; lower movements are going really well and the elbow is improving.

- **Mon** - rest day hanging out with Goga. **Tue** - squat was moderate/heavy with good form; noticed the bar is uneven with the left side being lower. **Wed** - deadlift was significantly easier than last week, even with back-to-back Lower days; starting with the hips lower helps by engaging the legs more. **Thur/Fri/Sat/Sun** - rest days visiting Zuka in WC. **Recap** - short but decent week. Elbow is finally starting to feel better.

- **Mon** - RDL form was better, keep focusing on greater ROM but with a straight back and on loading the hamstrings. **Tue** - both Push and Pull movements felt stronger than last week; slight forearm pain on pullups. **Wed** - rest. **Thur** - focused on good deadlift form, I think it's getting a little better. **Fri** - lifted at LFJCC for the first time and aggravated my right shoulder and forearm/elbow again on Larsen press. **Sat** - rest. **Sun** - rest/wrenching. **Recap** - week was going great until I re-injured myself, so not a good week overall.

I look forward to going up in weight on bench and OHP next week.

- Started Alec Enkiri's 6-week program. **Mon** - squat and RDL both felt light, lunge was the most tiring exercise; also did a 2 mile slow tempo run prior, which felt great. **Tue** - used a narrower grip and a good arch on bench with no pain, go up in weight slightly next week; OH press was also painless; BB row causes right forearm pain so stick to DB row for now; skipped pushups; no pain on neutral grip pullups; ran in the morning. **Wed** - sprints felt great. **Thur** - first deadlift in 3 weeks, no shoulder pain, slight forearm pain but it's manageable; deadlift, squat, and hip thrust all felt light. **Fri** - no pain on the first 3 movements, slight forearm pain on tri extensions; skipped the inverted row as it was causing too much forearm pain just like BB row did. Go up in weight on both OHP and bench press next week. **Sat** - rest day. **Sun** - rest day. **Recap** - Solid week overall. Shoulder is feeling much better and I'm starting to go up in weight on Push movements. Right forearm still hurts but only prevents me from doing pronated Pull movements.

- **Mon** - rest day. **Tue** - squat was heavy, form was mediocre overall but the ROM was still good; RDL was light. **Wed** - rest day. **Thur** - felt strong on the row but it aggravated my forearm again. **Fri** - rest day; forearm hurt like a bitch. **Sat** - rest day; ended up wrenching most of the day **Sun** - rest/wrench day again. **Recap** - shitty week hampered by ongoing forearm and shouler injuries; only put in two days of work.

- **Mon** - was hung over and bitched out. **Tue** - doubled up on Push and Pull. Bench was moderate for the first 3 sets and then heavy; OH press was moderate. Right shoulder pain got worse after bench, left one is fine. **Wed** - squat was moderate: RDL was light; minimal shoulder pain. **Thur** - row seems to be the only pulling movement that doesn't cause shoulder pain; slight leg/glute soreness. **Fri** - rested since I can't do any Push movements. **Sat** - paused squat was moderate/heavy; RDL was even lighter than on Wed; go up on BSS next week; no shoulder or forearm pain. **Sun** - rested. **Recap** - not a good week overall due to the right shoulder injury, but it's feeling much better so I remain hopeful that it will heal fully in 2 more weeks.

- **Week 8:** 1 rep max tests. **Mon** - rest day. **Tue** - started at 7:30 pm, didn't feel great because I was sleep deprived thanks to Lu. Heavier weights were moving slowly and my form was poor; lift-off and breathing cadence were inconsistent; forgot to use wrist straps until 305, which moved slower than in the last cycle; form was really bad on the missed 315; took a deep breath before unracking on my last rep, which I think helped. I hit the J-cups on the way up but still got it. I'm definitely happy with my new 320 PR but there's a lot of opportunity for improvement on the technique front. Ache in both shoulders. **Wed** - rested day; left shoulder is better but the right one still hurts like a bitch. **Thur** - started around 7 pm, felt pretty good. I was pretty sure I would get a new PR but I didn't expect 300, which is a 25 lb improvement and was my EOY goal. The form was also significantly better than on my previous PR. I put on the belt at 225, for the first time the entire training cycle. What I think helped: (1) my back was rested, not having done any heavy deadlifts since week 3 due to the right forearm injury, (2) I gripped the bar hard and pressed up on it slightly which provided a more solid platform, (3) but perhaps most importantly, I think it was the focused work on good form throughout the cycle on both back and front squats. Add slightly more weight and start using the belt in the second half of the next cycle. **Fri** - rest day; no leg or back pain; shoulders feel better. **Sat** - started at 7 pm, felt good. Not having deadlifted since week 3, my form was poor throughout. I'm breaking at the knees first which gets the bar too far out in front of me and my back ends up doing all the work at the end. Grip gave out on 395 both times, otherwise I would've had it. While I was hoping for a PR, without any deadlift training in 5 weeks, just matching my old PR was still solid. No back pain and no additional shoulder or forearm pain, so start hitting hard again come next week. **Sun** - rested. **Recap** - OK training cycle overall. I need to focus more on good form to prevent getting injured so much.

- **Week 7:** deload week - 50% of 1RM intentsity and 50% of regular volume (2-3 sets of 6-8 reps). **Mon** - got rained out. **Tue** - doubled up on Pull and Push; did Pull movements for the first time since injuring my forearm in Week 4; it still hurts but didn't seem to get any worse; I felt it the most on BB row. **Wed** - felt the forearm a bit on the RDL but it's wasn't bad; light deadlift should be ok to start with. **Thur** - curl didn't cause any forearm pain, go up in weight. **Fri** - felt good. **Sat** - no forearm pain on deadlift, start loading it up again. **Sun** - rest. **Recap** - better week overall, felt good to start doing Pull movements again.

- **Week 6:** 2 reps on main movements. **Mon** - rested again, forearm still hurts. **Tue** - bench was heavy but I kept good form except for the very last rep which caused pain in both shoulders; wrist wraps helped, start using them with 250+. **Wed** - squat was heavy but I maintained good form for the most part, except for the last 1-2 reps; supersetted GM and lunge. **Thur** - rested. **Fri** - rested. **Sat** - squat was moderate/heavy with good form, could've done 4 reps; lunge is getting stronger, go up to 125; skipped front squat to prevent aggravating the shoulders. **Sun** - rushed the workout in the morning and ran out of time; OH press was heavy, started the 2nd set too low and only got one rep, consider dropping the weight and focusing on full ROM. **Recap** - Another mixed week due to the nagging forearm injury.

- **Week 5:** 4 reps on main movements. **Mon** - right forearm still hurts so I can't do any pulling movements. **Tue** - bench was moderate/heavy, form was better; developed an ache in my right shoulder. **Wed** - surprisingly, squat was only moderate; go for reps 5-6 next week with 235; pecs were quite sore. **Thur** - forearm is getting better but it's not healed yet. **Fri** - OH press was moderate/heavy; bench was heavy; no pain. **Sat** - back squat was heavy; front squat was moderate/heavy; go up 115 on lunge. **Sun** - rested. **Recap** - I'm happy with Push and Legs but forearm still hurts so I didn't do any Pull movements or deadlift.

- **Week 4:** 6 reps on main movements. **Mon** - pullups/chinups were light/moderate, go up in reps and/or sets next week; hurt my right forearm. **Tue** - forearm pain was bad and it sapped my energy; bench was moderate/heavy. **Wed** - squat was moderate, go for 5-6 reps next week with 225; forearm still hurts so I skipped RDL; should've done BB lunge instead of air lunge. **Thur** - pulling movements hurt my forearm so I skipped the Pull day and rested. **Fri** - tried push press but my form was crap so did OH press instead; stick with OH press for now until push press form gets better; it was moderate/heavy; bench was moderate; try to go for 3 reps at least a couple times next week. **Sat** - both squats felt moderate and form was good; forearm felt better after swimming but still didn't want to risk it with deadlift. **Sun** - did cardio again. **Recap** - mediocre training week due to the forearm injury.

- **Week 3:** 8 reps on main movements. **Mon** - videoed my BB row for the first time and I'm far too upright, so I'm not engaging the lats much; consider dropping the weight if I'm not able to bend over more. **Tue** - didn't feel highly energetic at 4:30 PM; bench was moderate, last couple of reps on the last two sets were tough; tweaked my right forearm on wtd pullups the night before. **Wed** - 12:30 PM start time in the hot sun also wasn't optimal; squat was moderate/heavy; RDL was light. **Thur** - BB row form was better; curl felt good but I didn't have much left afterward for pullups. **Fri** - OH press form was better but the bar path is still not straight; bench was heavy so I rested longer in between sets. **Sat** - both deadlift and front squat form were better than last week and both also felt lighter. **Sun** - rested and hung out with Luka at the pool. **Recap** - another solid training week.

- **Week 2:** 10 reps on main movements. **Mon** - felt good, no pain. **Tue** - felt good; only the last couple reps of the last bench set were tough. **Wed** - kept good form on squat, tried a narrower stance which seemed to engage quads a bit more. **Thur** - got rained out. **Fri** - doubled up on Pull and Push; push press last set was tough but my form was better; bench was a little lighter than expected. **Sat** - deadlift last two sets were tough, but I kept good form for the most part, much better than last week, and I didn't have any lower back pain afterward; still, it's tough to maintain good form throughout a long set, so consider lower rep ranges come next cycle, starting with 8 or even 6; paused squats felt good, solid quad engagement. **Sun** - rested and played with Luka most of the day; no pain or stiffness. **Recap** - solid training week.

- Started a new 8-week program. +5 pounds on bench, OH/push press, BB row, and BB curl. +10 pounds on deadlift and RDL.
- **Week 1:** 12 reps on main movements. **Mon** - got rained out. **Tue** - doubled up on Pull and Push; superset bench and BB row; the last bench set was tough; pull was a little weak, probably due to Sunday's max pullup test; no pain. **Wed** - started at 4 PM, chest was sore but otherwise felt good; beltless squats were tough, especially the last two sets, but I kept good form throughout. **Thur** - started at 6:30 PM, chest and legs were sore but felt good. **Fri** - legs were still sore but felt good; OH press and bench press last sets were tough. **Sat** - front squat form needs work, bar kept sliding forward and down; go up in weight on BSS. **Sun** - back and shoulders were sore so the walk felt good to loosen up.

- **Week 8:** 1 rep max tests. **Mon** - rested one more day after a long weekend trip to Vegas. **Tue** - started at around 5:30 PM, felt strong but not my strongest. **Squat:** tried to focus on good form and depth; the last lift was challenging but I probably could've gone up another 10#; I'm still happy with the 275 PR though because my form this time was much better than my last 275. **Bench**: lighter weights were moving fast, heavier weights felt a little slower than usual; form was OK but I noticed in the videos that my butt was coming off the bench slightly and I kept shuffling my feet after unracking the bar; overall I'm very happy with the 315 PR and I feel better about being on track to 325 by the EOY. **Wed** - rest day, no aches or pain. **Thur** - rest day. **Fri** - started in the morning around 9:30; felt strong. **Deadlift:** felt good; form was better but I still need to stand up a little later so that my back isn't doing most of the heavy pulling; I missed 405 twice (second attempt was much closer than the first) but I'm still happy with the 375 PR; I'm going to change my 2021 goal to 425; add grip work and maybe start experimenting with mixed grip. **OH Press:** needs a lot of work, my form is inconsistent; I started out with thumbless grip but switched to a regular grip at 175; I got a 180 PR but I'm not thrilled with it due to poor form. **Sat** - rest and light cardio, no aches or pain. **Sun** - was slightly hung over but 18 pullups is still solid.

- **Week 5:** 4 reps on main movements. Switching to Pull-Push-Legs. **Mon** - felt good; pullup/chinup form was better than last week. **Tue** - felt pretty good considering I slept poorly the night before. **Wed** - squats were really tough again; I tried to improve my form over last week but had limited success; I should drop the weight and focus on improving my form before going up in weight; RDL felt light, probably due to having a couple of extra days in between. **Thur** - felt good; switching to only overhand on BB row; very little pain. **Fri** - felt good; slight ache in the shoulders during push press, need to keep focusing on good form; go for 215x8 on paused bench next week. **Sat** - felt good; slight pinch in the lower left back during DL, need to use my legs more and back less. **Sun** - decided to rest to heal my back.

RDL, GM, and lunge were OK. Bench felt light but was really painful so I decided to skip push press and accessory work. **Wed** - side pain was bearable on rows but really bad on pullups and curls so I skipped those. **Thur** - some pain on deadlift but was bearable; didn't want to risk it on squats. **Fri** - got rained out. **Sat** - did both push and pull in the AM; felt pretty good; pain is still there but it's tolerable.

- Started a new 8-week program: 6 weeks of progressively increasing weight every week, deload on week 7, and 1-rep max tests on week 8.
- **Week 1:** 12 reps on main movements. **Mon** - beltless squats were challenging; RDL and GM less so; no pain. **Tue** - felt like shit after sleeping poorly because of Meu-Meu; bench felt light; OH press was challenging, especially the last 2 sets; no pain. **Wed** - felt like crap after hanging out with sick Lu all day but had a decent workout overall; no pain. **Thur** - felt pretty good; no pain. **Fri** - two heavy OH press movements per week is a bit much; start alternating intensity between OH press and push press. **Sat** - got rained out. **Sun** - felt strong after a rest day.

- **Mon** - still had a slight pain so didn't want to risk it with squats; lunges and RDL felt good. **Tue** - felt good on both bench and beltless OH press; I'm wondering if my injury really was caused by the belt. **Wed** - the last set of pullups/chinups aggravated the injury slightly, otherwise felt good. **Thur** - no pain on beltless deadlifts. **Fri** - no pain; still beltless. **Sat** - slight pain again on pullups/chinups; stick to BW for now.

- **Mon** - squats felt really good but developed a slight pain on the left side of the abdomen below the rib cage towards the end; at first I thought it was from the weight belt but the pain got worse the next day. **Tue** - dips were really painful, bench and OH press were OK but felt weak. **Wed** - still in pain after sleeping like crap, pullups and chinups were painful, BB row and curls were fine. **Thur** - decided to do the sensible thing and not aggravate my injury. **Fri** - bench and lat/front raises felt OK but the pain was still there. **Sat** and **Sun** - decided to fully rest in hopes to recover from my injury.
